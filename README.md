# Biol 020 Dynamic Genome Unit: Nematode DNA Barcoding

Welcome to Dynamic Genome! This repository contains tutorials, molecular methods and other materials we will be utilizing in the Biol 020 Dynamic Genome Class. If you have questions and/or comments, please post them in the issues section of this reposoitory. 

Your instructor for this until will be Dr. Holly Bik, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Nematology at UC Riverside. Her lab website is here: https://biklab.github.io 

## 2018 Class Schedule

#### Week 5

**Mon Oct 29th** - Begin DNA extractions of Nematodes (2hr protocol: ), followed by introductory lecture on nematode research in the Bik Lab. 

**Wed Oct 31st** - start PCR of three 18S rRNA gene fragments (three different primer sets to be used per worm)

#### Week 6

**Mon Nov 5** - Run gels and Redo PCRs as needed for worms and primer sets that didn't work.

**Wed Nov 7** - Field Trip to Botanic gardens (soil sample collections - keep samples in fridge until next week)

#### Week 7

**Mon Nov 12** - No Class (Veteran's Day)

**Wed Nov 14** - Soil/Sediment extraction demo, portable SEM demo and begin nematode microscopy (taxonomic identifications and drawings)


#### Week 8

**Mon Nov 19th** - Continue nematode microscopy - picking and identifications. 

**Wed Nov 21** Begin basecalling of Sanger sequences (quality checking and )

#### Week 9

**Mon Nov 26th** - Finish basecalling of Sanger squences if needed. Introduce BLAST and begin identifications of nematodes (using video capture images and web searches for morphology)

***Wed Nov 28th** - continue bioniformatics - maybe command line or metabarcoding tutorial if we have time
