# Biol 020 Dynamic Genome Unit: Nematode DNA Barcoding

Welcome to Dynamic Genome! This repository contains tutorials, molecular methods and other materials we will be utilizing in the Biol 020 Dynamic Genome Class. If you have questions and/or comments, please post them in the issues section of this reposoitory. 

Your instructor for this until will be Dr. Holly Bik, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Nematology at UC Riverside. Her lab website is here: https://biklab.github.io 

## 2018 Class Schedule

Before we get started on Week 5, please complete this pre-class assessment survey (it will only take 5 minutes!): https://goo.gl/forms/8Ct1Solza2oGglAE3

### Week 5

**Mon Oct 29th** - Begin DNA extractions of Nematodes ([Click here for DNA extraction protocol](https://github.com/BikLab/Biol020-DynamicGenome/blob/master/protocols/nematode-DNA-extractions.md)), followed by introductory lecture on nematode research in the Bik Lab. 

**Wed Oct 31st** - start PCR of three 18S rRNA gene fragments, using three different primer sets to be used per worm ([Click here for nematode PCR protocol](https://github.com/BikLab/Biol020-DynamicGenome/blob/master/protocols/PCR-18S-rRNA.md)) 

### Week 6

**Mon Nov 5** - Run Electrophoresis Gels for PCR products generated last Wednesday (check for ~800bp gel bands and postive/negative controls worked as expected; [Follow Electrophoresis Gel protocol here](https://github.com/BikLab/Biol020-DynamicGenome/blob/master/protocols/Gel-Electrophoresis.md)). Redo PCRs as needed for worms and primer sets that didn't work ([Redo this same PCR protocol from last week](https://github.com/BikLab/Biol020-DynamicGenome/blob/master/protocols/PCR-18S-rRNA.md)). Short discussion on Botanic Gardens sampling - how to collect samples and location metadata.

**Wed Nov 7** - Field Trip to Botanic gardens to collect soil samples for nematoe extractions. [Click here for sampling guielines and procedures](https://github.com/BikLab/Biol020-DynamicGenome/blob/master/protocols/botanic-gardens-sampling.md).

### Week 7

**Mon Nov 12** - No Class (Veteran's Day)

**Wed Nov 14** - Soil/Sediment extraction demo, portable SEM demo and begin nematode microscopy (taxonomic identifications and drawings). Redo any futher PCRs as needed to obtain good gel bands for all three primer sets for one nematode worm.


### Week 8

**Mon Nov 19th** - Continue nematode microscopy - picking and identifications. 

**Wed Nov 21** Begin basecalling of Sanger sequences (quality checking and )

### Week 9

**Mon Nov 26th** - Finish basecalling of Sanger squences if needed. Introduce BLAST and begin identifications of nematodes (using video capture images and web searches for morphology)

**Wed Nov 28th** - continue bioniformatics - maybe command line or metabarcoding tutorial if we have time
