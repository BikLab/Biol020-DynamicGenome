### Electrophoresis Gels

After completing PCR reactions, the PCR products will need to be run on electrophoresis gels in order to check for successful amplification of the target 18S rRNA gene fragment. Your positive and negative controls will also be run on the gel to troubleshoot any problems. Negative controls should have no gel bands (the presence of bands indicates condaminated reactions). Positive controls should have very strong gel bands (if you see no bands here it means your PCR reaction did not work properly).

#### Preparing samples for gel

In a 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube, you will need to combine loading dye (green) with a small volume of each PCR product. Only ONE PCR reaction should be put in each tube (Don't combine multiple PCR reactions together). Loading dye helps you visually see your PCR reaction as you load it onto the gel. 

To each tube, add:

* 3ul loading dye (6x Orange loading dye - from ThermoScientific O'GeneRuler 1kb Plus DNA ladder kit, Product ID SM1343)
* 15ul PCR product 

#### Running samples on gel

Now it is time to load the gels. 

1. In the first gel well, you will need to add a DNA Ladder - this is a standard "ruler" we use to check for the correct length of our expected PCR products. The ladder we'll be using is the ThermoScientific O'GeneRuler 1kb Plus DNA ladder (Product ID SM1343)
2. In the next wells, add your PCR products with loading dye. Add ONE PCR reaction in each well, and keep going across the empty wells until you have loaded all your PCR reactions.
3. Put on the cover and start running the gel. It should be run at **170 volts for 30 minutes**
4. After 30 minutes is up, take the gel out of the box and visualize the bands on the UV box. Take a digitial photo of your gel, and check your band size against the 1kb DNA ladder. Which PCR reactions showed successful amplification?
