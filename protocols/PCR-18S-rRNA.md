### PCR amplification of nematode 18S rRNA genes

We will be amplifying the full length 18S ribosomal RNA gene (~1600bp) in three separate fragements. The primer sets you will be using are: 

**Primer Set 1**

* G18S4_M13_DGclass (forward)
* 26R_M13_DGclass (reverse)

**Primer Set 2**

* 22F_M13_DGclass (forward)
* 13R_M13_DGclass (reverse)

**Primer Set 3** 

* 24F1_M13_DGclass (forward)
* 18P_M13_DGclass (reverse)

### PCR Reaction Setup (50ul volume)

* 5 ul nematode DNA extract template
* 16 ul of molecular grade water
* 2 ul of Forward primer (10uM concentration)
* 2 ul of Reverse primer (10uM concentration)
* 25 ul of Accuzyme Mix containing dNTPs (Product ID: [BIO-25028](https://www.bioline.com/us/accuzyme-mix.html#specification))

### PCR Program

Use the following PCR program:

* 95 degrees for 3:00 min 

**35x cycles of:**

* 95 degrees for 45 sec
* 55 degrees for 1 min 
* 72 degrees for 1:30 min 

**followed by:**

* 72 degrees for 10:00 min 
* hold at 4 degrees.

### Instructor Prep

1. Order primers and dilute stock solution down to 10uM 
2. Order positive control ([Zymo Microbionics Community Standard](https://www.zymoresearch.com/zymobiomics-community-standard) or C. elegans DNA) and dilute stock solution to make template DNA for positive PCR controls
3. PCR reactions should be set up so that each table of students (3 or 4 students per table) pipets worm DNA and controls into one strip of PCR tubes (e.g. 4 worms plus 2 controls). Each table will then carryout PCR recipe calculations and make a mastermix for ONE primer set at a time. 
4. Once finished, students should put strip tubes on the PCR machine or on a 96-well plate at the front of the classroom
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 with second and third primer sets.
6. Start PCR reactions once class has finished preparing reactions for all three primer sets.
