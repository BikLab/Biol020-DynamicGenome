### UCR Botanic Gardens sample collection

Today's class is a field trip to the UCR Botanic Gardens - we'll collect soil samples that will be used to demonstrate live nematode extractions in class next week.

When you arrive at the Botanic Gardens, split into groups of 3 or 4 people (stick with the same people at your table in the DG class labs). Each group should plan to collect 3-4 soil samples from around the Botanic Gardens.

#### Guidelines and procedures for sampling:

* Walk around the Botanic Gardens first to look at all the different locations where you could sample. Choose 3 or 4 different sites that have different habitat characteristics (soil type, vegetation, moisture, elevation, etc.)
* Using a plastic spoon, collect a handful of soil from each location you choose and put it into a clean ziplock bag
* Using a sharpie marker, label the Ziploc bag with the date and location description. Make sure also record this information in your lab notebook (computer or paper)
* Take down a descriptio of the sample site - describe the soil, vegetation, whether it is sunny or shady, close to water, or any other characteristics that may be useful.
* Drop a pin on Google Maps and record the GPS location of the sample site. You will need this for your lab notebook.
* Take a photo of the sample location on your smartphone. You will need this for your lab notebook.
* At the end of class, the instructors and TAs will collect your soil samples in a box and store them in the fridge until class next week.
