## Nematode DNA Extractions

Each student will have a 1.5ml tube containing a nematode specimen that has been picked into 25ul of molecular grade water. 

In this first lab you will add "Worm Lysis Buffer" (WLB) to each tube and put the worms on an heat block to carry out the DNA extraction. WLB is a buffer containing the Proteinase K enzyme, which physically breaks down the nematode cell membranes and releases DNA from the nucleus. If you're interested, the recipe for WLB is here: https://github.com/BikLab/protocols/blob/master/wet-lab/worm_lysis_buffer.md

### Protocol Steps

1. Take a 1.5 ml tube from the course instrutors (each tube contains a nematode). Make a note of your unique sample ID on the top of your tube - you will need this later!

2. Thaw the liquid in the tube if it is frozen. Once thawed, be sure to keep the tube on ice.

3. Add 25ul of Worm Lysis Buffer (WLB) to each nematode tube.

4. Place the tube with WLB onto a heat block at 65°C for 2 hours. If the heat block is a ThermoMixer unit or equipped with shaker capabilities, set the heat block to also shake at 750rpm. **Important:** if the heat block has a lid, make sure to set the lid temperature to 100°-105°C to stop the liquid from evaporating from the bottom of the tube. This protocol step will activate the Proteinase K enzyme to start breaking down the nematode cells.

5. After 2 hours, transfer the nematode tube to another heat block at 100°C for 5 minutes. This step will stop the reaction by inactivating the Proteinase K enzyme.

6. Transfer nematode tubes to a -20°C freezer for storage.
